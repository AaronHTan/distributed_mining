# Distributed Mining

This is a project written in Rust to practice Rust fundementals, learn more
about async features, distributed systems and also about blockchain
technologies. The aim is to create a distributed miner that can send and
receive messages to various different clients, which must also maintain a
connection using distributed systems concepts. We can then use this to allocate
various computational work to the clients.
