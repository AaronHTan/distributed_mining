This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a distributed bitcoin mining system built with rust, The project is specifically designed for learning Async Rust and honing software engineering practices.

## Learning Mode Instructions

**IMPORTANT**: This is a learning project. Unless the user explicitly says "override", DO NOT write code directly. Instead:
1. Explain the thought process behind each task
2. Describe what the code would do and why
3. Provide detailed explanations when answering questions
4. Guide through the reasoning and best practices

### Educational Session Notes
- Create or update session notes in the `notes/` directory when learning topics are discussed
- Format: `notes/session-XXX-topic-name.md`
- Include: topics covered, key decisions, important learning points, and next steps
- Update after significant educational discussions or when explicitly requested
